	<h2>About OBOC</h2>
	<p>OBOC is the University of Rochester’s longest-running musical theater group. Each semester, the club presents a musical revue with numbers from a great variety of Broadway and Off-Broadway shows. The revues are produced, directed, choreographed, accompanied with a pit orchestra, musically arranged, costumed, and performed entirely by students.</p>

	<p>The musical revues put on every semester comprise of around 16-20 songs, all from different musicals. The Fall revue generally happens around mid-November while the Spring revue happens around mid-April. In order to ensure that every OBOC revue while enrolled in the University is a new and fun experience for everyone involved, a song is never not be used more than once every four years.</p>
