	<h2>Executive Board Members</h2>
	<p>The OBOC Executive Board is comprised of nine members that are elected by the group as a whole. They include the President, Vice-President, Business Manager, Publicity Director, Secretary, Music Director, Social Chair, and Communications Chair. The purpose of the Executive Board is to serve as a group facilitator, ensuring that every member's voice is heard within the group as well as making decisions that the E-Board believes will benefit the group as a whole.</p>

	<p>The Executive Board holds weekly meetings in which various matters are discussed regarding the group. As a member of the OBOC Executive Board, each person voices his/her opinion in Executive Board meetings about what decisions he/she believes will best improve the efficacy of the group. Weekly Executive Board meetings are generally open to all members, and general members can run for positions on E-board after being active members of the club for 2 semesters.</p>
